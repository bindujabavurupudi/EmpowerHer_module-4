Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)

Frontend (FE) is the part of web application which user can see and use. It works on client side and focuses on appearance and interaction.

User Interface

Frontend is responsible for designing the user interface of the website. It shows buttons, forms, images, text and layouts. It makes sure the website looks good and is easy to use on mobile, laptop and other devices.

User Interaction

Frontend handles all actions done by the user like clicking buttons, typing in input fields and submitting forms. It gives instant feedback like loading messages or error messages. It helps user to interact smoothly with the application.

Communication with Backend

Frontend sends requests to backend through APIs to get or send data. It receives the response from backend and displays the data properly to the user. So frontend acts as a bridge between user and backend.




Q2. Role of Backend (BE)

Backend (BE) is the server side part of a web application. It works behind the scenes and user cannot see it directly.

Server-side Processing

Backend handles all the logic and processing of requests. When frontend sends data, backend processes it and decides what response should be sent back.

Database Handling

Backend connects with database to store, update, delete and fetch data. All user information, orders, posts etc are managed by backend through database queries.

Security and Authentication

Backend is responsible for security of the application. It handles user authentication like login and signup. It also checks permissions and protects data from unauthorized access.



Q3. Business Logic

Business Logic is the core logic of an application which defines how the system should behave according to business rules. It decides what should happen when a user performs an action.

Examples of Business Logic

E-commerce Website
If a product is out of stock, user should not be able to place order. Discount is applied only if order amount is above certain value.

Banking Application
User cannot withdraw more money than available balance. Interest calculation is done based on account type.

Food Delivery App
Delivery charge changes based on distance. Order can be cancelled only before food is prepared.



Q4. Client–Server Model

Client–Server Model is a network architecture where client requests services and server provides those services.

Client

Client is the user side application like web browser or mobile app. It sends requests to server and displays the response to the user.

Server

Server is a powerful system that stores data, runs backend logic and handles client requests.

Communication

Communication happens through HTTP/HTTPS requests. Client sends request to server, server processes it and sends back response.




Q5. Three-Tier Architecture

3-Tier Architecture divides a web application into three separate layers to improve scalability and maintenance.

Presentation Layer

This is the frontend layer. It handles user interface and user interaction.

Application (Business) Layer

This layer contains business logic. It processes requests and applies rules.

Data Layer

This layer handles database operations like storing and retrieving data.

Why it is used

This architecture is used because it improves security, scalability and makes the application easier to manage and modify.



Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language

JavaScript is widely used as a backend language because of its speed and flexibility.

Performance

JavaScript is fast because it uses non-blocking and asynchronous execution. It can handle many requests at the same time.

Ecosystem

JavaScript has a very large ecosystem with many libraries and packages which makes development faster.

Popular Backend Frameworks

JavaScript has popular backend frameworks like Express.js and NestJS which help in building scalable backend applications easily.
